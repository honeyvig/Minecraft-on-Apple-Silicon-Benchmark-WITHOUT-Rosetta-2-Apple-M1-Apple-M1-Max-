# Minecraft-on-Apple-Silicon-Benchmark-WITHOUT-Rosetta-2-Apple-M1-Apple-M1-Max
To benchmark Minecraft natively on Apple Silicon (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max) without using Rosetta 2, you can follow these steps. Minecraft doesn't yet have native Apple Silicon support for its official game client. However, you can still run Minecraft natively on Apple Silicon with Java (via a native ARM64 JDK) and some optimizations. Below, I'll guide you through a method for running Minecraft 1.17+ on Apple Silicon without Rosetta 2.

This guide assumes that you are comfortable with setting up the environment, compiling Java, and dealing with Apple M1 architecture-specific settings.
Steps to Run Minecraft Natively on Apple Silicon (Without Rosetta 2)
1. Install a Native ARM64 Java Development Kit (JDK)

Minecraft requires Java to run, and for Apple Silicon, we need a JDK that is compiled for ARM64 architecture. The latest versions of AdoptOpenJDK and Azul Zulu provide ARM64 Java distributions.

    Install Azul Zulu OpenJDK ARM64 for macOS:
        Download the ARM64 version of Zulu OpenJDK from the Azul website.
        Choose the macOS ARM64 version (e.g., Zulu OpenJDK 11 or 17).
        Follow the installation instructions to install the JDK on your system.

    Alternatively, you can install it using Homebrew:

    brew install --cask zulu17

2. Install Minecraft Java Edition

Download the Minecraft Java Edition for macOS from the official Minecraft website. The downloaded file will be in .dmg format.

Once you’ve installed Minecraft, navigate to the folder where the application is located.
3. Configure Minecraft to Use Native ARM64 JDK

To make sure Minecraft runs natively with ARM64, we need to specify the path to the ARM64 JDK in the Minecraft launcher:

    Find the path to the ARM64 JDK: After installation, find the installed JDK by running:

/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17

This should return the path to the ARM64 version of Java.

Configure the Minecraft launcher:

    Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to Settings (click on the three dots in the top right).
    Scroll down to the Java Settings section.
    Under Java Executable Path, set the path to the ARM64 JDK you installed earlier.

Example path might look like this:

    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java

    Disable Rosetta 2: Make sure Minecraft is not running under Rosetta 2 by verifying that the launcher and Java are both native ARM64. To do so:
        Open Activity Monitor while Minecraft is running.
        Check the Kind column to ensure that Minecraft is not using Rosetta (Intel instead of Apple).

4. Optimize Minecraft for Performance on Apple Silicon

Apple Silicon chips have specific hardware optimizations that you can take advantage of when running Minecraft.

Here are a few recommendations to optimize performance:

    Increase allocated RAM:
        In the Minecraft Launcher, go to Settings → Java Settings and adjust the allocated RAM to utilize the available memory in your system.

    Disable V-Sync and Adjust Graphics Settings:
        Turn off V-Sync and adjust graphical settings to improve performance. You can do this within the game’s Video Settings. Reducing settings like Render Distance, Smooth Lighting, and Particles can boost performance.

    Enable Metal: Minecraft 1.17+ now supports Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API, which can improve performance compared to OpenGL.

    To enable Metal rendering:
        Go to Settings → Video Settings in Minecraft and ensure that Use VBOs and Render with Metal are enabled (if available).

5. Benchmarking Minecraft

After configuring everything, you can start Minecraft and monitor the performance. For benchmarking, follow these steps:

    Enable FPS Counter: In Minecraft, go to Options → Video Settings → Show FPS. This will show your frames per second on the screen.

    Run a Stress Test:
        Create a new world with high settings (large render distance, max graphics settings).
        Use the Built-in Benchmarking Tool (e.g., a timed session running around the world or in complex areas with a lot of objects and chunks).

    Monitor Performance with Activity Monitor:
        Open Activity Monitor and look for the CPU, GPU, and RAM usage while the game is running.
        Keep an eye on how the Apple M1 chip handles multi-threaded tasks and its efficiency during the benchmark.

6. Sample Command to Run Minecraft from Terminal (without Rosetta 2)

To run Minecraft using the ARM64 JDK directly from the terminal without Rosetta 2, use this command:

cd /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home java -Xmx4G -Xms2G -cp MinecraftLauncher.jar net.minecraft.client.Minecraft

This assumes you have a path set up for the ARM64 Java (adjust the JAVA_HOME path accordingly). The -Xmx and -Xms flags set the maximum and minimum memory allocated to Minecraft (in gigabytes).
Conclusion

Running Minecraft natively on Apple Silicon involves ensuring that the Java runtime is compiled for ARM64 architecture, adjusting the Minecraft launcher settings, and optimizing the game for Apple's hardware. By disabling Rosetta 2 and using the ARM64 JDK, you can benchmark and play Minecraft on M1, M1 Pro, or M1 Max chips with improved performance compared to running it under Intel emulation.
